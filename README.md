# Women-Clothing-Sentiment-Analysis
This repository focuses on sentiment analysis for women's clothing e-commerce reviews. The goal is to develop a model capable of predicting whether customers will recommend the products they review to their friends. By leveraging NLP techniques, we aim to classify the reviews into two categories: positive recommendations and non-recommendations.
 The main steps of the project include:

1. Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into the dataset, understanding the distribution of key variables, and identifying patterns or trends in customer reviews.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features from the review data that can be used for sentiment analysis. This may involve text preprocessing and feature extraction.

4. Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify customer reviews into positive and negative sentiments. Evaluating and comparing different sentiment analysis approaches.

5. Visualization: Visualizing the sentiment analysis results and review characteristics using appropriate charts, graphs, or interactive visualizations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/:** Contains the dataset used for sentiment analysis and any additional data if required.
- **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks documenting the step-by-step process of the project, from data preprocessing to sentiment analysis and visualization.
- **results/:** Outputs of the project, including visualizations, sentiment analysis results, and any additional findings.
- **README.md:** The main documentation file providing an overview of the project and its contents.
