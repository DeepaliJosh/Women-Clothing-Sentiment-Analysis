# Women-Clothing-Sentiment-Analysis
This repository focuses on sentiment analysis for women's clothing e-commerce reviews. The goal is to develop a model capable of predicting whether customers will recommend the products they review to their friends. By leveraging NLP techniques, we aim to classify the reviews into two categories: positive recommendations and non-recommendations.
